                    <h3>Location Services</h3>
                    <p>
                        Allow for the app to use your location services. We need
                        access to your location services so as to get where you're
                        using the app from. We show the User location on the app. We
                        promise to keep it private.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Add a Favourite</h3>
                    <p>

                        location selected, click on the 'Favourite' Button to add it
                        onto your favourites.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Get the forecast</h3>
                    <p>

                        get the real-time and the 5 day forecast of the location.
